Imagine that you are an AWS \"Super User\" who is in charge of your organization's AWS account. You have heard about services such as Amazon GuardDuty, Inspector, and Macie that can help you monitor the data, host, and network traffic within your AWS environment and detect anomalous behaviors. You want to give your team members enough access to these services to perform their job responsibilities but you are concerned about giving them too much access. You will learn how to use Amazon IAM to delegate access to these services to AWS Security Administrators and AWS Security Operators. For the purposes of this round, AWS Security Administrators require full access to AWS security services while AWS Security Operators only require \"read only\" access to the services. You will use AWS IAM roles to do this and thereby promote the Principle of Least Privilege - giving users the minimum level of privilege they need to do their tasks. AWS Service/Feature Coverage : AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) Console role-switching Amazon GuardDuty Amazon Inspector Amazon Macie Agenda This round is broken down into Build and Verify Phases. BUILD (45 min): At a high level, in the Build Phase you will do the following: Build the environment using AWS CloudFormation in the us-east-1 (Northern Virginia) region. Perform further customization on the environments to restrict the capabilities of the Security Operator Role. Test your customizations. Pass your credentials to another team to verify the configuration of your environment. VERIFY (30 min): The Verify Phase involves testing the work that another team did in building the environment to ensure the requirements were met. You will do the following: Obtain the login credentials from another team that has performed the steps in the Build Phase. Test the environment to determine if the Security Operator role has been properly configured. Document any variances. This workshop can be done as a team exercise or individually. The instructions are written with the assumption that you are working as part of a team but you could just as easily do the steps below individually. If done as part of an AWS sponsored event then you'll be split into teams of around 4-6 people. Each team will do the Build Phase and then hand off their accounts to another team. Then another team will do the Verify Phase. NOTE FOR TEAMS : If you are doing this exercise as a team and sharing an AWS account , each team member should take turns \"driving.\" Some services such as GuardDuty and Macie apply to the whole account so only one team member should control that AWS service. Assumptions and Prerequisites You will need an AWS account for this lab and administrative credentials. These may be provided by an event sponsor. You should be familiar with AWS core services such as AWS CloudFormation and Amazon S3. You should also be comfortable using the AWS console. The instructions are written with the understanding that the account is new or clean. We strongly recommend that you do not do these labs in work or \"production\" accounts. Architecture Overview The environment in this round consists of an AWS account in which Amazon GuardDuty, Amazon Inspector, Amazon Macie and Amazon CloudTrail will run. The CloudTrail logs will be sent to an Amazon S3 bucket. The template also creates two AWS IAM roles. The first role is for a Security Administrator which has full access to the External Security Services. The second role is for Security Operators. The Security Operator role initially is very similar to the Security Administrator role but you will modify the permissions of the Security Operator role to provide \"read only\" access to the External Security Services. The use of Security Administrator/Operator roles is very common in organizations that want to delegate the use of security services to different security teams. Here is a picture of what you will build. Preparation You will need an AWS account and the associated administrative login credentials. These may be provided by an event sponsor.

Imagine that you are an AWS \"Super User\" who is in charge of your organization's AWS account. You have heard about services such as Amazon GuardDuty, Inspector, and Macie that can help you monitor the data, host, and network traffic within your AWS environment and detect anomalous behaviors. You want to give your team members enough access to these services to perform their job responsibilities but you are concerned about giving them too much access. You will learn how to use Amazon IAM to delegate access to these services to AWS Security Administrators and AWS Security Operators. For the purposes of this round, AWS Security Administrators require full access to AWS security services while AWS Security Operators only require \"read only\" access to the services. You will use AWS IAM roles to do this and thereby promote the Principle of Least Privilege - giving users the minimum level of privilege they need to do their tasks.

BUILD (45 min): At a high level, in the Build Phase you will do the following: Build the environment using AWS CloudFormation in the us-east-1 (Northern Virginia) region. Perform further customization on the environments to restrict the capabilities of the Security Operator Role. Test your customizations. Pass your credentials to another team to verify the configuration of your environment. VERIFY (30 min): The Verify Phase involves testing the work that another team did in building the environment to ensure the requirements were met. You will do the following: Obtain the login credentials from another team that has performed the steps in the Build Phase. Test the environment to determine if the Security Operator role has been properly configured. Document any variances. This workshop can be done as a team exercise or individually. The instructions are written with the assumption that you are working as part of a team but you could just as easily do the steps below individually. If done as part of an AWS sponsored event then you'll be split into teams of around 4-6 people. Each team will do the Build Phase and then hand off their accounts to another team. Then another team will do the Verify Phase. NOTE FOR TEAMS : If you are doing this exercise as a team and sharing an AWS account , each team member should take turns \"driving.\" Some services such as GuardDuty and Macie apply to the whole account so only one team member should control that AWS service.","title":"Agenda"},{"location":"delegation/#assumptions-and-prerequisites","text":"You will need an AWS account for this lab and administrative credentials.

Please make sure you have read the scenario section before continuing below. --- The AWS Console sometimes displays news and information about AWS features. Feel free to close such windows to give you the maximum amount of free space on your screen.. Additionally, if you are sharing accounts as part of a team, each of you should take turns using the console because some of the services can only be used by one person at a time. Sign in to AWS Depending on how you're doing this workshop, expand one of the following dropdowns to sign into AWS. Click here if you're at an AWS event where the Event Engine is being used Step 1 : Retrieve temporary credentials from Event Engine Navigate to the Event Engine dashboard Enter your team hash code. Click AWS Console Copy the export commands under the Credentials section for the temporary credentials (you will need these in the next step.) Click Open Console from the Event Engine window Click here if you're at an AWS-sponsored event and AWS provided an account to you In a separate tab in your web browser, go to the URL provided to you and login. After you login click the AWS Account box, then click on the Account ID displayed below that (the red box in the image.) You should see a link below that for the Management console . Click on that and you will be taken to the AWS console. Click here if you are using your own AWS account (whether you are at an AWS event, a separate event or online) In a separate tab in your web browser, go to https://aws.amazon.com/console and log into your account. Enable Macie You will need Macie for this lab so you must make sure Amazon Macie is running. Select Macie from the main console. Macie will open in a new browser tab. Select the us-east-1 (N. Virginia) region in the Macie console. When the Macie console appears, if a Getting Started button appears, it means that Amazon Macie is disabled. In that case, click Getting Started , confirm that US East (N. Virginia) is selected as the region, and click Enable Macie . This may take from several seconds to complete. The Macie console will appear after Macie has been enabled. Close the browser tab containing the Macie console. Enable GuardDuty You will also need GuardDuty for this lab so you will now enable GuardDuty. Return to the AWS Console, signing into the account again if necessary. Select GuardDuty from the main console. If you see a Get Started button, click it. If the region is not set to Northern Virginia, select Northern Virginia (or N. Virginia) for the region. Click Enable GuardDuty . Build out the environment * NOTE : The instructions that follow are based on the classic version of the CloudFormation console. CloudFormation also offers a redesigned console that offers a different overall look and feel. You are welcome to use the redesigned CloudFormation console. If you choose to do so, you will notice some minor differences from the instructions below. Open the Deploy to AWS link that follows in a new browser tab to deploy the logging environment in the us-east-1 region: In the new browser tab that you just opened, you will see the Select Template page. Click Next . On the Specify Details/Parameters page, the values have been filled in for you. Click Next . On the Options page, click Next . On the Review page, check the I acknowledge box and click Create . The acknowledgement is requested because of the creation of resources with custom names. The CloudFormation template does this when it creates certain resources with names that make it easier to identify them. CloudFormation will now begin to create the resources. Refresh the entire browser window to view the progress. This takes about five minutes. Wait until the Status value for the esslab stack shows CREATE_COMPLETE . You can refresh the browser window to update the status. Take a look at the outputs for the esslab CloudFormation stack. They will look similar to the picture below. You may need to drag the horizontal dividing line upwards to see all the output values. The output value assigned to LoggingBucketName is the name of the bucket into which AWS CloudTrail will deliver its logs. Copy the value of LoggingBucketName to a scratch file on your workstation so you have it available later. The value assigned to SecAdministratorRoleURL is a URL that you will use later in the lab to temporarily \"switch to\" (meaning take on the access privileges of) a Security Administrator role. This role has full administrative privileges for AWS CloudTrail, Amazon GuardDuty, Amazon Inspector, and Amazon Macie. The value assigned to SecOperatorRoleURL is a URL that you will use later in the lab to temporarily \"switch to\" a Security Operator role. You will later modify the policy associated with this role so it only has \"read only\" privileges for AWS CloudTrail, Amazon GuardDuty, Amazon Inspector, and Amazon Macie. Let's take a look at CloudTrail logging. The most important part of collecting AWS CloudTrail information into an Amazon S3 bucket is setting the correct permissions on the Amazon S3 bucket. Go to the S3 console, check the box next to the bucket with the name assigned to LoggingBucketName which you note in Step 6, click on Permissions , and then Click on Bucket Policy . Note that the policy allows the CloudTrail service to read the ACL of the LoggingBucket and also to create logs with prefixes containing the AWS account ID. you can read more about this policy at this link . Now click the Overview tab and then click the AWSLogs folder prefix. You should then see the AWS account ID of your account as shown below. This shows that AWS CloudTrail logs for your account have started to make their way to the S3 bucket. It may take up to five minutes for logs to start appearing. You can go further into the directory by year, month, and day to see logs as they appear. The logs are stored in \".gz\" (gzip) format. If you have an archive management tool and you see one of these log files, feel free to download it to your workstation and expand the archive. Again, it may take several minutes for the logs to begin to appear. Understanding Roles A role is a security principal, an actor, that has a set of policies and a trust relationship. A user, an application, or an AWS service can assume the role in order to substitute its own access privileges for those associated with the role. The policies define what AWS actions the role can perform. The trust relationship defines who is allowed to assume the role. The CloudFormation stack you just built created two roles. One role is for a Security Administrator who has full access to CloudTrail, GuardDuty, Inspector, and Macie. The other role is for a Security Operator who, after changes you make later on, will have read-only access to these services. You are going to switch to the Security Administrator role but before doing so, let's look at the privileges associated with that role so you can see what it does. Go to the IAM console, select Roles on the left and search for the string SecAdministrator . You can search either by using your browser's search capability or you can type SecAdministrator into the search box. Click on the role that you retrieve. The policy definition will be similar to the image below. You may need to click Show more to see all of the policies. There are six managed policies attached to this role, five of them are provided by AWS for GuardDuty, Inspector, CloudTrail, IAM, and SNS. While you will not be working directly with SNS and IAM, the policies for SNS and IAM are included because including them provides for a better console experience. There is a sixth managed policy that was created for Amazon Macie to illustrate how custom managed policies can be developed. Click on each of the managed policies to see the underlying privileges of each. Note that there are some services, such as Amazon EFS (Elastic File System), that are not granted by any of these policies. You will confirm this lack of access later in this workshop. From the main page of the role, click the Trust relationships tab. You will see a section on the page telling you that the trusted entity (the entity that can assume the role) is the 12-digit AWS account ID as shown below. This means that any principal in the account can assume the role. The internal representation of the trust relationship is a JSON policy document. Click Show policy document . You will see a policy similar to that shown in the picture below. In the principal entry, you will see a value that ends in \":root.\" This is a special principal identifier that refers to the account itself. This policy says that every principal in the account (users, roles, etc.) is allowed to use the sts:AssumeRole action to take on the identity of the role. You can read more about principal identifiers here . STS stands for Security Token Service . The AssumeRole API associated with the service creates temporary credentials when you call the API that are associated with the security policies of the role including an access key and a secret access key. Your application then uses these security tokens to make calls to other AWS APIs with the policies defined in the role. Switching to the Security Administrator role You are now going to learn about how to switch to a new role in the AWS console. Switching to a new role allows you to temporarily substitute your AWS console permissions for those contained in another role. In this lab, you will be switching to roles that are in your own AWS account. You can also switch to roles in other AWS accounts to gain access to resources in accounts other than your own. This is known as cross-account access . You will not be doing cross-account access in this lab. There are two ways you can switch roles. You can use the Switch Role command that's available as a drop down from the console under your account name. Alternatively, you can use a URL that does the switching for you. You will use both methods below. Go to the CloudFormation console and view the outputs tab of the CloudFormation stack named esslab you just built. Click on the URL next to SecAdministratorRoleURL . You may need to scroll down to see it. A new browser tab window will appear showing information similar to the image below. The box contains the account ID (which is the ID of your AWS account), a role name that was created by CloudFormation, and a Display Name. You can also select a color that will be used to display the role you assume in the console. Click Switch Role . You will now see a new role label named SecAdministrator in the top of your console window as shown below. This means that your effective privileges have been temporarily replaced with those of the SecAdministrator role. Go to the Amazon EFS console. Notice that you get a message telling you that you do not have access to any of the features of the console. This is because none of the underlying policies grant any access to any part of Amazon EFS. Now go to the Amazon Inspector Console. To verify that you have administrative capabilities for Inspector, you are going to clone an existing template. Click Assessment Templates and check the box to the left of the template name that begins with LampInspectorAssessmentTemplate and click Clone . A section of the form will appear. Scroll down towards the bottom and click the Create button. Refresh the screen. You should now see two templates that begin with LampInspectorAssessment . If you widen the Name column you will see that the newly created template contains the string \"Cloned.\" You have just successfully cloned an assessment template which shows that you have administrative access privileges for Inspector. Now go to the GuardDuty console and select the Settings menu item. To verify that you do have administrative capabilities for GuardDuty, scroll down to the field named Updated findings and change the value to Send notification every 1 hour and click Save settings at the bottom of the window (you may need to scroll down further). You will see a message at the top of your window (you may need to scroll up) saying that the settings have been saved. This shows you do have full access to GuardDuty . Go to the Macie console, select the US West (Oregon) region, click Settings, and click on the Content Type icon. You will see a list of file types appear. Pick a file type such as application/cap , click the edit widget (it looks like a pencil), change the value of the Enabled flag to No - disabled . This shows that you have administrative access to Macie. Close the Macie window. Go back to the console session that you had for GuardDuty and from there go to the CloudTrail console. Click Trails and then click the trail whose name begins with esslab . Toggle the Logging switch to OFF. You will be asked to confirm. Click Continue . Now toggle Logging back to ON. This shows that you have administrative access to CloudTrail. Now that you have confirmed that you have administrative access to Inspector, Macie, GuardDuty, and CloudTrail, you no longer need your temporary permissions. Click on the SecAdministrator label and select Back to on the bottom right of the menu as shown below. Also note that the console maintains a role history to make it easier for you to switch back to the SecAdministrator role later. After you switch back to your regular role the special role label for SecAdministrator is no longer displayed. Refine the Security Operator role permissions Now that you know how to switch to the Security Administrator role, you are going to make some changes to the permissions for the Security Operator role so that it only has read-only access to Macie, GuardDuty, Inspector, and CloudTrail. Go to the IAM console, select Roles and search for SecOperator . Click on the resulting role that you see. The role will have permissions similar to those shown in the picture below. Notice that there are once again managed policies, five AWS-managed policies for Inspector, GuardDuty, CloudTrail, IAM, and SNS, and a custom managed policy for Macie. The managed policies for Inspector, GuardDuty, and CloudTrail still provide full access to the services. The Macie policy (whose name contains SecOperatorMaciePolicy ), despite its name, still provides full access to Macie. There are also SNS and IAM policies to provide for a better console experience. Remove the AmazonCloudTrailFullAccess, AmazonGuardDutyFullAccess, and Amazon InspectorFullAccess policies by click on the removal crosses as shown by the arrows. Add read-only access policies for Inspector, CloudTrail, and GuardDuty. Also modify the SecOperatorMacie policy so that it provides read-only access to Macie. If you need some hints, open the dropdown below. Click here to expand Here are some links that offer information that may be helpful to you. Open them in a new browser tab for more information. Controlling access to Amazon CloudTrail Controlling access to Amazon GuardDuty Controlling access to Amazon Inspector Controlling access to Amazon Macie Go to the CloudFormation console and view the outputs tab of the CloudFormation stack named esslab you built earlier. Click on the URL next to SecOperatorRoleURL. A new browser tab window will appear showing information similar to the image below. The box contains the account ID (which is the ID of your AWS account), a role name that was created by CloudFormation, and a Display Name. You can also select a color that will be used to display the role you assume in the console. Click Switch Role . You will now see a new role label named SecAdministrator in the top of your console window as shown below. This means that your effective privileges have been temporarily replaced with those of the SecOperator role. Now go to the Amazon Inspector Console. Click Assessment Templates and check the box to the left of both of the template names that begin with LampInspectorAssessmentTemplate and click Delete . You will be asked to confirm the deletion. Click Yes . After 30 or so seconds you will see an error message telling you that you are not authorized to call the inspector:DeleteAssessmentTemplate action. This is because you have read-only access to Inspector. Now go to the GuardDuty console, click Settings , change the Updated findings field to a different value, and click Save settings . You will see an error message telling you that you are not authorized to perform the UpdateDetector action. You may need to scroll up to see it. This is because you have read-only access to GuardDuty. Go to the Macie console, select the US West (Oregon) region, click on Settings and click on the Content Type icon. You will see a list of file types appear. Pick a file type such as application/java , edit it and change the value of the Enabled flag and click Save . You will receive an error message because you have read-only access to Macie. Close the Macie window. Go back to the console session that you had for GuardDuty and from there go to the CloudTrail console. Click Trails and click the trail whose name begins with esslab . Toggle the Logging switch to OFF. Click Continue . You will receive an error message because you have read-only access to CloudTrail. Now switch back to your default role. After you to this the SecOperator role label will no longer appear on your console.

Notice that there are once again managed policies, five AWS-managed policies for Inspector, GuardDuty, CloudTrail, IAM, and SNS, and a custom managed policy for Macie. The managed policies for Inspector, GuardDuty, and CloudTrail still provide full access to the services. The Macie policy (whose name contains SecOperatorMaciePolicy ), despite its name, still provides full access to Macie. There are also SNS and IAM policies to provide for a better console experience.

In these tasks you will be creating policies and testing them. It helps to divide the team into people doing the tasks and people testing things out. Setup Instructions To setup your environment please expand one of the following drop-downs (depending on how if you are doing this workshop at an AWS event or individually ) and follow the instructions: AWS Sponsored Event Console Login: if you are attending this workshop at an official AWS event then your team should have the URL and login credentials for your account. This will allow you to login to the account using AWS SSO. Browse to that URL and login. After you login click AWS Account box, then click on the Account ID displayed below that (the red box in the image.) You should see a link below that for Management console . Click on that and you will be taken the AWS console. Make sure the region is set to Ohio (us-east-2) CloudFormation: Launch the CloudFormation stack below to setup the environment: Region Deploy US East 2 (Ohio) Click the Deploy to AWS button above. This will automatically take you to the console to run the template. Click Next on the Select Template section. Click Next on the Specify Details section (the stack name will be already filled - you can change it or leave it as is) Click Next on the Options section. Finally, acknowledge that the template will create IAM roles under Capabilities and click Create . This will bring you back to the CloudFormation console. You can refresh the page to see the stack starting to create. Before moving on, make sure the stack is in a CREATE_COMPLETE . Individual Log in to your account however you would normally CloudFormation: Launch the CloudFormation stack below to setup the environment: Region Deploy US East 2 (Ohio) Click the Deploy to AWS button above. This will automatically take you to the console to run the template. Click Next on the Select Template section. Click Next on the Specify Details section (the stack name will already be filled - you can change it or leave it as is) Click Next on the Options section. Finally, acknowledge that the template will create IAM roles under Capabilities and click Create . This will bring you back to the CloudFormation console. You can refresh the page to see the stack starting to create. Before moving on, make sure the stack is in a CREATE_COMPLETE . Task 1 Create an IAM user and an IAM policy with permission to create managed policies, IAM roles and Lambda functions Build an IAM policy so that web admins can create customer managed policies, IAM roles and Lambda functions. They should only be able to edit the policies, roles and lambda functions they create. Attention As you use the provided IAM policy hints in each task, keep in mind where you need to add the account ID, correctly use the resource restrictions and change the region specified if needed (although if you are taking this as part of an AWS event, please use the Ohio region or us-east-2.) Missing any of these items can cause issues with your policies Walk Through Browse to the IAM console . On the first screen you see in the IAM console (which should be the Dashboard) find the IAM users sign-in link . Copy that link because you will need the account ID in the URL for the policies and you will need the entire URL when you hand this account to another team for the VERIFY phase. Click Users on the left menu and create a new IAM user named webadmin . Check AWS Management Console access and then either autogenerate a password or set a custom password. Uncheck Require password reset . Attach the AWS managed policies IAMReadOnlyAccess & AWSLambdaReadOnlyAccess to the user. Next click Policies on the left menu. Create a new IAM policy based on the hint below. Attach this policy to the webadmin IAM user you just created. Hint IAM Identifiers : You will want to use either naming or pathing resource restrictions in the IAM policy. The question marks \" ???? \" in the resource element below should be replaced with something that could act as a resource restriction. Examine the existing resources (roles, Lambda functions) to make sure the policy will give access to existing resources owned by the web admins. Replacing the question marks is really the key to this round. { \"Version\" : \"2012-10-17\" , \"Statement\" : [ { \"Sid\" : \"CreateCustomerManagedPolicies\" , \"Effect\" : \"Allow\" , \"Action\" : [ \"iam:CreatePolicy\" , \"iam:DeletePolicy\" , \"iam:CreatePolicyVersion\" , \"iam:DeletePolicyVersion\" , \"iam:SetDefaultPolicyVersion\" ], \"Resource\" : \"arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:policy/????\" }, { \"Sid\" : \"CreateRoles\" , \"Effect\" : \"Allow\" , \"Action\" : [ \"iam:CreateRole\" , \"iam:UpdateRole\" , \"iam:DeleteRole\" , \"iam:AttachRolePolicy\" , \"iam:DetachRolePolicy\" ], \"Resource\" : [ \"arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:role/????\" ] }, { \"Sid\" : \"LambdaFullAccesswithResourceRestrictions\" , \"Effect\" : \"Allow\" , \"Action\" : \"lambda:*\" , \"Resource\" : \"arn:aws:lambda:us-east-2:ACCOUNT_ID:function:????\" }, { \"Sid\" : \"PassRoletoLambda\" , \"Effect\" : \"Allow\" , \"Action\" : \"iam:PassRole\" , \"Resource\" : \"arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:role/????\" , \"Condition\" : { \"StringLikeIfExists\" : { \"iam:PassedToService\" : \"lambda.amazonaws.com\" } } }, { \"Sid\" : \"AdditionalPermissionsforLambda\" , \"Effect\" : \"Allow\" , \"Action\" : [ \"kms:ListAliases\" , \"logs:Describe*\" , \"logs:ListTagsLogGroup\" , \"logs:FilterLogEvents\" , \"logs:GetLogEvents\" ], \"Resource\" : \"*\" } ] } As you complete the following tests, keep in mind the resource restriction you set up in the policy above ( ???? ). Use the IAM users sign-in link you gathered earlier to login: Login with the webadmin IAM user (using a different browser) to verify the user can create a policy. The permissions you set on the policy do not matter at this point. Also verify you can create a role (while following the resource restriction.) This role should use Lambda as the trusted entity (we will use this role to test the next task) an attach the policy you just created to it. Finally verify the user can create a lambda function with the role you just created attached. Question Why are we using resource restrictions here? There are two ways of doing resource restrictions: naming and pathing. Which option are we using here? Which option allows you to create policies using both the AWS Console and CLI? Task 2 Create a permissions boundary The webadmin user can create IAM polices, IAM role and Lambda functions. We now need to limit the permissions of the roles the user create. If not then the web admins could simply create new policies with full admin rights, attach these to the roles, pass these roles to Lambda functions and escalate their permissions (either intentionally or inadvertently). We will use permissions boundaries to limits the effective permissions of the roles. The permissions boundary should allow the following effective permissions for any role created by the web admins: i. Create log groups (but can not overwrite any other log groups) ii. Create log streams and put logs iii. List the objects from the S3 bucket name that starts with \"web-admins-\" and ends in \"-data\" Walk Through: Create a new IAM policy that will act as the permissions boundary for the web admins. Hint IAM Identifiers : The question marks ???? in the resource element below should be replaced with something that could act as a resource restriction. { \"Version\" : \"2012-10-17\" , \"Statement\" : [ { \"Sid\" : \"CreateLogGroup\" , \"Effect\" : \"Allow\" , \"Action\" : \"logs:CreateLogGroup\" , \"Resource\" : \"arn:aws:logs:us-east-2:ACCOUNT_ID:*\" }, { \"Sid\" : \"CreateLogStreamandEvents\" , \"Effect\" : \"Allow\" , \"Action\" : [ \"logs:CreateLogStream\" , \"logs:PutLogEvents\" ], \"Resource\" : \"arn:aws:logs:us-east-2:ACCOUNT_ID:log-group:/aws/lambda/????:*\" }, { \"Sid\" : \"AllowedS3GetObject\" , \"Effect\" : \"Allow\" , \"Action\" : [ \"s3:List*\" ], \"Resource\" : \"arn:aws:s3:::web-admins-ACCOUNT_ID-*\" } ] } Name the policy webadminpermissionboundary Question What do you attach the permission boundary to? How does a permissions boundary differ from a standard IAM policy? How could you test the permissions boundary at this point? Task 3 Update the permission policy for the webadmin to incorporate the permissions boundary condition Walk Through Create a policy that references the permissions boundary we just created. It is recommended that you just create a new policy and use the example below. Note that the policy below contains two additional sections (the last two sections) that we did not address in the earlier tasks. The additions are focused on denying the ability to change or delete the permission policy and the permissions boundary. Hint permissions boundaries : The question marks ???? in the resource elements below should be replaced with something that could act as a resource restriction. { \"Version\" : \"2012-10-17\" , \"Statement\" : [ { \"Sid\" : \"CreateCustomerManagedPolicies\" , \"Effect\" : \"Allow\" , \"Action\" : [ \"iam:CreatePolicy\" , \"iam:DeletePolicy\" , \"iam:CreatePolicyVersion\" , \"iam:DeletePolicyVersion\" , \"iam:SetDefaultPolicyVersion\" ], \"Resource\" : \"arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:policy/????\" }, { \"Sid\" : \"RoleandPolicyActionswithnoPermissionBoundarySupport\" , \"Effect\" : \"Allow\" , \"Action\" : [ \"iam:UpdateRole\" , \"iam:DeleteRole\" ], \"Resource\" : [ \"arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:role/????\" ] }, { \"Sid\" : \"CreateRoles\" , \"Effect\" : \"Allow\" , \"Action\" : [ \"iam:CreateRole\" , \"iam:AttachRolePolicy\" , \"iam:DetachRolePolicy\" ], \"Resource\" : [ \"arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:role/????\" ], \"Condition\" : { \"StringEquals\" : { \"iam:PermissionsBoundary\" : \"arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:policy/webadminpermissionboundary\" } } }, { \"Sid\" : \"LambdaFullAccesswithResourceRestrictions\" , \"Effect\" : \"Allow\" , \"Action\" : \"lambda:*\" , \"Resource\" : \"arn:aws:lambda:us-east-2:ACCOUNT_ID:function:????\" }, { \"Sid\" : \"PassRoletoLambda\" , \"Effect\" : \"Allow\" , \"Action\" : \"iam:PassRole\" , \"Resource\" : \"arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:role/????\" , \"Condition\" : { \"StringLikeIfExists\" : { \"iam:PassedToService\" : \"lambda.amazonaws.com\" } } }, { \"Sid\" : \"AdditionalPermissionsforLambda\" , \"Effect\" : \"Allow\" , \"Action\" : [ \"kms:ListAliases\" , \"logs:Describe*\" , \"logs:ListTagsLogGroup\" , \"logs:FilterLogEvents\" , \"logs:GetLogEvents\" ], \"Resource\" : \"*\" }, { \"Sid\" : \"DenyPermissionBoundaryandPolicyDeleteModify\" , \"Effect\" : \"Deny\" , \"Action\" : [ \"iam:CreatePolicyVersion\" , \"iam:DeletePolicy\" , \"iam:DeletePolicyVersion\" , \"iam:SetDefaultPolicyVersion\" ], \"Resource\" : [ \"arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:policy/webadminpermissionboundary\" , \"arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:policy/webadminpermissionpolicy\" ] }, { \"Sid\" : \"DenyRolePermissionBoundaryDelete\" , \"Effect\" : \"Deny\" , \"Action\" : \"iam:DeleteRolePermissionsBoundary\" , \"Resource\" : \"*\" } ] } Name the new policy webadminpermissionpolicy and attach it to the webadmin user. Remove the earlier policy you added during the testing. When you are done the webadmin user should have only three policies attached: webadminpermissionpolicy, IAMReadOnlyAccess & AWSLambdaReadOnlyAccess. Again from the browser where you are logged into the console as the webadmin , verify the user can create a policy, create a role (attaching both a permission policy and permissions boundary to the role) and finally create a Lambda function into which you will pass that role. Keep in mind the resource restriction. Question Why do we add the Deny for DeletePolicy actions regarding the webadminpermissionboundary & webadminpermissionpolicy? What would happen if we didn't deny the ability to delete permissions boundaries? Task 4 Gather info needed for the VERIFY phase Walk Through Now that you have setup the IAM user for the web admins, it's time to pass this information on to the next team who will work through the VERIFY tasks. You need to gather some details about your setup and then hand this info to the next team. Here are all of the details you need to pass to another team. If you following the recommended naming conventions than you can use the answers below. If you were given a form to fill out then enter the info into the form. This needs to be given to another team so they can do the VERIFY phase tasks. Your team should collect the VERIFY phase form from another team so you can also work through the VERIFY tasks. IAM users sign-in link: https://Account_ID.signin.aws.amazon.com/console IAM user name: webadmin IAM user password: Resource restriction identifier: permissions boundary name: webadminpermissionboundary Permission policy name: webadminpermissionpolicy Tip Do not hand out this info to the same team that is giving you the info - this way we will end up properly swapping between teams if we have an odd number of teams.

AWS Service/Feature Coverage : AWS IAM users & roles AWS IAM permissions boundaries AWS IAM friendly names and paths AWS Lambda The three elements of a permissions boundary are represented below. When your team does the BUILD tasks in this section you will act as the admins. When your team does the VERIFY tasks in the next section you will act as the delegated admins (webadmins). Scenario Your company has deployed a production three tier web application on AWS. Various teams work on different aspects of the architecture including the web admins who need to be able to create IAM roles for Lambda functions. In order to let them quickly iterate it was decided that permissions boundaries would be used to delegate permissions to the web admins so they can create the roles needed without being able to escalate their permissions or impact the resources of other teams. It is your assignment to set their permissions up and test them. Agenda The round consists of a BUILD phase followed by a VERIFY phase. Phases BUILD (60 min): First each team will act as the admins of the account and carry out the activities involved in the BUILD phase where they will set up access for the web admins. Then each team will hand credentials for the webadmins IAM role in their account to another team to carry out the VERIFY phase. VERIFY (30 min): In the Verify phase each team will then act as the web admins validate that the requirements were set up correctly in the BUILD phase. Team or Individual Exercise This workshop can be done as a team exercise or individually. If done as part of an AWS sponsored event then you will most likely be split into teams of around 2-3 people (you are of course free to work on your own.) If you are working in a team then try to divide up the tasks.

Missing any of these items can result in problems and errors like \"An error occurred (MalformedPolicyDocument) when calling the CreatePolicy operation: The policy failed legacy parsing\" . Tip Tasks 1, 2 and 3 can be done independently if you are working in a team and want to divide up the tasks. Setup Instructions To setup your environment expand the appropriate choice from the following drop-downs, perform the steps, and then move on to Task 1 Click here if you are using your own AWS account . You will be using your computer to run the commands. Log in to your account however you would normally. You should use an IAM user or role with admin rights. CloudFormation: Launch the CloudFormation stack below to setup the environment: Region Deploy US East 1 (Virginia) Click the Deploy to AWS button above. This will automatically take you to the console to run the template. Click Next under the Create stack section. Click Next under the Specify stack details section (the stack name will already be filled - you can leave the other options in Parameters at their default settings too) Click Next under the Advanced options section. Finally, acknowledge that the template will create IAM resources with custom names under Capabilities and click Create stack . This will bring you back to the CloudFormation console. You can refresh the stack set to see the latest status. Before moving on, make sure the stack finally shows CREATE_COMPLETE . You will need to configure the AWS CLI on your computer with an access key from a principal (IAM user, role, etc) that has at least IAM Full Access and sts:AssumeRole (in order to complete the cleanup at the end, you will also need Lambda Full Access and CloudFormation Full Access.) Then move on to Task 1 . Click here if you're at an AWS event where the Event Engine is being used. You will be using Cloud9 to run the commands. Step 1 : Retrieve temporary credentials from Event Engine Navigate to the Event Engine dashboard Enter your team hash code. Click AWS Console Copy the export commands under the Credentials section for the temporary credentials (you will need these in the next step.) Step 2 : Connect to the AWS Console via Event Engine and browse to the AWS Cloud9 IDE Click Open Console from the Event Engine window Navigate to the AWS Cloud9 console. Click on Open IDE in the workshop-environment under Your environments Click the gear image icon in the upper right hand corner to open the Cloud9 Preferences. Scroll down in the settings, click on the AWS SETTINGS section and click the button next to AWS managed temporary credentials to disable this. Now go to a Cloud9 terminal tab (tab title will start with the words bash ). Type aws configure --profile default hit enter. Hit enter until you get to the choice Default region name and type in us-east-1 . Hit enter and then enter again to leave this menu. Then create a file in the ~/.aws directory named credentials and paste in the credentials you copied from the Event Engine. You will need to remove the word export from the start of each line. Add [default] before all these rows. You should end up with something that looks like this: [default] AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=ASIA _ _ AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=iZoD _ _ _ __ AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=FQoG _ _ _ _ _ _ ___ Now you can run commands from within the Cloud9 IDE using the temporary credentials from Event Engine. If you open a new tab you will need to paste in the credentials again. Move on to Task 1 . Task 1 Create the webadmins role First you will create an IAM role for the webadmins (initially this role will trust your own AWS account but when you switch accounts with an another team in the Verify phase you will configure it to trust the other team's account): For many of the steps below you will need your account ID. To get that type in `aws sts get-caller-identity'. The account ID will be the first number listed after Account . (If you are using Cloud9, you can do this from a second terminal window so you can refer back to it later when needed.) Use the following JSON to create a file named trustpolicy.json for the trust policy (using your preferred text editor): { \"Version\" : \"2012-10-17\" , \"Statement\" : { \"Effect\" : \"Allow\" , \"Principal\" : { \"AWS\" : \"arn:aws:iam::<ACCOUNT_ID>:root\" }, \"Action\" : \"sts:AssumeRole\" } } Create the IAM role that will be used by the webadmins: aws iam create-role --role-name webadmins --assume-role-policy-document file://trustpolicy.json Attach the AWSLambdaReadOnlyAccess AWS Managed Policy to the role: aws iam attach-role-policy --policy arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSLambdaReadOnlyAccess --role-name webadmins Task 2 Create the permissions boundary the webadmins will use when creating roles Next you will create the policy that will be used as the permissions boundary. The permissions boundary should only allow the following actions: Create log groups, create log streams, put logs and list the files in the webadmins folder of the bucket that starts with \"shared-logging-\" and ends in \"-data\" : Use the following JSON to create a file named permissionsboundary.json for the permissions boundary policy: { \"Version\" : \"2012-10-17\" , \"Statement\" : [ { \"Sid\" : \"CreateLogGroup\" , \"Effect\" : \"Allow\" , \"Action\" : \"logs:CreateLogGroup\" , \"Resource\" : \"arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:<ACCOUNT_ID>:*\" }, { \"Sid\" : \"CreateLogStreamandEvents\" , \"Effect\" : \"Allow\" , \"Action\" : [ \"logs:CreateLogStream\" , \"logs:PutLogEvents\" ], \"Resource\" : \"arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:<ACCOUNT_ID>:log-group:/aws/lambda/*:*\" }, { \"Sid\" : \"AllowS3GetObject\" , \"Effect\" : \"Allow\" , \"Action\" : [ \"s3:List*\" ], \"Resource\" : \"arn:aws:s3:::shared-logging-<ACCOUNT_ID>-us-east-1-data\" , \"Condition\" : { \"StringEquals\" : { \"s3:prefix\" : \"webadmins\" } } }, { \"Sid\" : \"OtherPermissionsNeeded\" , \"Effect\" : \"Allow\" , \"Action\" : [ \"dynamodb:PutItem\" , \"dynamodb:UpdateItem\" , \"dynamodb:DeleteItem\" ], \"Resource\" : \"*\" , \"Condition\" : { \"StringEquals\" : { \"aws:RequestedRegion\" : \"us-east-1\" } } } ] } Create the policy: aws iam create-policy --policy-name webadminspermissionsboundary --policy-document file://permissionsboundary.json Question To what object will the webadmins attach the permissions boundary? How does a permissions boundary differ from an identity-based policy? Task 3 Create the identity-based policy for the webadmins Hint IMPORTANT!!!! - The question marks ???* in the policy below should be replaced with something that could act as part of a resource restriction. The end result is that you will have a pathing requirement for the roles and policies. Replacing the ???* is one of the key challenges in this workshop and probably the most confusing part. The trailing use of the wildcard * in the ARN allows for any combination of zero or more characters following what you put in place of the question marks. Talk to a facilitator if you have issues with this. Next you will create the policy that will be attached to the webadmins role.

Questions Why were there some blocks in the policy above that used the permissions boundary condition and some that did not? Why are we using pathing here? There are two ways of doing resource restrictions: naming and pathing. Which option allows you to create policies using both the AWS Console and CLI? Why do we add the Deny for DeletePolicy actions regarding the webadminspermissionsboundary & webadminspermissionpolicy? Is this actually needed? Task 4 Test the webadmins permissions It's time to check your work and make sure the webadmins are set up properly. The instructions for how to test the setup can be found in the VERIFY phase . The VERIFY phase assumes you are checking another team's setup but for your own testing this will be just done in your own account.

Replace \"SHARED_LOGGING_BUCKET_NAME\" with the name of bucket that begins with \"shared-logging-\" and ends in \"-data\" . Also replace \"PREFIX_FROM_PERMISSIONS_BOUNDARY\" with the prefix the permissions boundary requires for that bucket. In order to find the bucket name, just run aws s3 ls --profile webadmins . In order to find the prefix, examine the permissions boundary policy from the BUILD phase. What is an S3 prefix? In Amazon S3, buckets and objects are the primary resources, and objects are stored in buckets. Amazon S3 has a flat structure instead of a hierarchy like you would see in a file system. However, for the sake of organizational simplicity, the Amazon S3 console supports the folder concept as a means of grouping objects. Amazon S3 does this by using a shared name prefix for objects (that is, objects that have names that begin with a common string). Object names are also referred to as key names. For example, you can create a folder on the console named photos and store an object named myphoto.jpg in it. The object is then stored with the key name photos/myphoto.jpg, where photos/ is the prefix. const AWS = require ( 'aws-sdk' ); const s3 = new AWS . S3 (); exports . handler = async ( event ) => { console.log('Loading function') ; const allKeys = [] ; await getKeys({ Bucket : 'SHARED_LOGGING_BUCKET_NAME' , Prefix : 'PREFIX_FROM_PERMISSIONS_BOUNDARY' } , allKeys ); return allKeys ; } ; async function getKeys ( params , keys ) { const response = await s3.listObjectsV2(params).promise() ; response.Contents.forEach(obj => keys.push(obj.Key)) ; if (response.IsTruncated) { const newParams = Object.assign({ } , params ); newParams . ContinuationToken = response . NextContinuationToken ; await getKeys ( newParams , keys ); } } Zip the index.js file for upload to Lambda zip lambdafunction.zip index.js Create a Lambda function aws lambda create-function --function-name verifyfunction --runtime nodejs10.x --role arn:aws:iam::<ACCOUNT_ID_FROM_OTHER_TEAM>:role/webadmins/NAME_OF_ROLE --handler index.handler --region us-east-1 --zip-file fileb://lambdafunction.zip --profile webadmins Invoke the Lambda function aws lambda invoke --function-name verifyfunction --region us-east-1 --invocation-type RequestResponse outputfile.txt --profile webadmins Examine the output file. If you see files marked that webadmins/you-should-SEE-this-file--webadmins... then you have successfully verified that the webadmins can do their job. Also make sure the function is generating logs in CloudWatch logs. (Optional) Test Lambda for alternate bucket prefix If time permits, repeat the previous steps in this task except create a new Lambda function such as verifyfunction1 and set bucket prefix in the new Lambda function code to appadmins . What are the contents of the output file when the new Lambda function is invoked? Why is the result different than with the webadmins bucket prefix? Congratulations!

Replace \"SHARED_LOGGING_BUCKET_NAME\" with the name of bucket that begins with \"shared-logging-\" and ends in \"-data\" . Also replace \"PREFIX_FROM_PERMISSIONS_BOUNDARY\" with the prefix the permissions boundary requires for that bucket. In order to find the bucket name, just run aws s3 ls --profile webadmins . In order to find the prefix, examine the permissions boundary policy from the BUILD phase. What is an S3 prefix? In Amazon S3, buckets and objects are the primary resources, and objects are stored in buckets. Amazon S3 has a flat structure instead of a hierarchy like you would see in a file system. However, for the sake of organizational simplicity, the Amazon S3 console supports the folder concept as a means of grouping objects. Amazon S3 does this by using a shared name prefix for objects (that is, objects that have names that begin with a common string). Object names are also referred to as key names. For example, you can create a folder on the console named photos and store an object named myphoto.jpg in it. The object is then stored with the key name photos/myphoto.jpg, where photos/ is the prefix. const AWS = require ( 'aws-sdk' ); const s3 = new AWS . S3 (); exports . handler = async ( event ) => { console.log('Loading function') ; const allKeys = [] ; await getKeys({ Bucket : 'SHARED_LOGGING_BUCKET_NAME' , Prefix : 'PREFIX_FROM_PERMISSIONS_BOUNDARY' } , allKeys ); return allKeys ; } ; async function getKeys ( params , keys ) { const response = await s3.listObjectsV2(params).promise() ; response.Contents.forEach(obj => keys.push(obj.Key)) ; if (response.IsTruncated) { const newParams = Object.assign({ } , params ); newParams .

Also make sure the function is generating logs in CloudWatch logs.

Identity Round Task 1 Since you are championing the security tasks for your team, you pick up the two tasks for the WildRydes application. Please read through and complete the following tasks. Good Luck! Build Phase Reduce the attack surface of the S3 origin Ensure the application serves content out through the CloudFront Distribution and that your end users can only access the application through CloudFront URLs and not Amazon S3 URLs. As part of this configuration your end users should not be able to affect the availability or integrity of the application. Key Security Benefits Obfuscates the S3 origin Forces traffic over HTTPS with custom certificates Adds DDoS protection to your application and enables the future use of AWS WAF and AWS Shield View the Existing Policy First, view the existing S3 bucket policy to see what permissions the previous engineers created. Go to the Amazon S3 console Click on the identity-wksp-serverless-< ACCOUNT# >-us-east-1-wildrydes bucket. Click on the Permissions tab and then click on Bucket Policy . What's wrong with this policy? What does \"Principal\": \"*\" mean? Both \"Principal\": \"*\" and \"Principal\":{\"AWS\":\"*\"} grant permission to everyone (also referred to as anonymous access). Use caution when granting anonymous access to your S3 bucket. When you grant anonymous access, anyone in the world can access your bucket. We highly recommend that you never grant any kind of anonymous write access to your S3 bucket. Modify Principal Since the current bucket allows for anonymous access, you need to change this to only allow access from the CloudFront Distribution. Go to the Amazon CloudFront console. You should see a Web Distribution for the WildRydes web application. Click on Origin Access Identities in the left navigation. You should see an identity named Unicorn OAI . CloudFront Origin Access Identity An Origin Access Identity (OAI) is a special CloudFront identity that you can associate with a Distribution in order restrict access using AWS IAM. You can also find the OAI by viewing your Web Distribution Copy down the ID. Go back to the Amazon S3 console and open up the bucket policy. Replace the principal with the following and click save : \"Principal\" : { \"AWS\" : \"arn:aws:iam::cloudfront:user/CloudFront Origin Access Identity <OAI ID>\" } , Info You could also use the canonical user id as the principal: \"CanonicalUser\": \"<OAI S3CanonicalUserId>\" Modify Actions Now that the principal is restricted to the identity associated with the CloudFront distribution you can take a closer look at the permissions. Go back to the Amazon S3 console and open up the bucket policy. Does CloudFront really need access to Delete Objects? The distribution is acting as a CDN for the static site so it only needs read access to the S3 bucket. Change the actions to ensure an end user can not affect the integrity of the site. Test the new bucket policy Now that the bucket policy has been updated, go validate that you can not access the website using an S3 URL. Open the Amazon CloudFormation console (us-east-1) Click on the Identity-RR-Wksp-Serverless-Round stack or the module-a7932bd25ca64049a57fd5bb055782db stack (this is the stack name when created using Event Engine). Click on Outputs and click on WebsiteS3URL . Are you still able to access the site using the S3 URL? Solve the Mystery So you've modified the bucket policy to restrict access to read only actions from the CloudFront Distribution but for some reason you are still able to access the site using S3 URLs. Do some investigation into why this is the case and put in the additional control necessary to restrict the traffic. Tip What other access controls exist within S3? Look into the following resources: S3 Block Public Access (easiest) AWS IAM Policy Elements: NotPrincipal (hardest) Be sure to clear your cache when testing! Verify Phase Reduce the attack surface of the S3 origin Now that the additional identity control has been added to the application, you have been tasked with acting as an end user and manually testing to verify that the control has been put in place correctly and that the requirements have been met. Ensure the application serves content out through the CloudFront Distribution and that your end users can only access the application through CloudFront URLs and not Amazon S3 URLs.
